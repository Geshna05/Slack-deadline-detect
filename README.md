** What is this ? **

An intelligent system that detects deadlines from chat messages on SLACK using NLP and sends real-time reminders.
This project is a Slack-integrated deadline detection and reminder system that helps teams stay on top of important deadlines and tasks. It uses Slack's API to detect and track deadlines mentioned within messages and sends automated reminders to keep everyone on track.
